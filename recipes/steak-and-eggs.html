    <p>Start your day with this breakfast of champions. A juicy, tender sirloin steak topped with a perfectly fried egg </p>
    <p>The recipe includes frying the steak and eggs and should be done in minutes!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 (6 ounce) top sirloin steak</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>Place steak between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound to a ¼-inch thickness. Season one side generously with salt and pepper, then sprinkle ½ of the bread crumbs over top. Place the plastic wrap back over the steak and pound a few times with the meat mallet. Repeat to season the other side with salt, pepper, and remaining bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Set a pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons melted clarified butter and wait until it starts to smoke. Quickly and carefully add steak to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Flip steak and reduce heat to medium-high; cook until you see a little bit of pink juice pool on top of the steak, about 1 more minute. Flip again, turn off the heat, and transfer steak to a warm plate.</li>
        <li>Let the pan cool for 30 to 60 seconds, then add 1 teaspoon melted clarified butter. Turn heat to medium and add egg. Break the egg white so it's all the same thickness and the yolk is in the center. Add a pinch of salt and cook until egg white is cooked through with brown and crispy edges. Place the egg beside the steak.</li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
    </ol>
